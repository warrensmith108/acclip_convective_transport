The accompanying code is used to analyze output from the ACCLIP convective transport diagnostic and produce figures for an upcoming publication in JGR-Atmospheres.

The process_airplane_traj3d.py script is designed to read the output from the convective transport diagnostic (available in a public format at https://doi.org/10.26023/DP1P-C32K-YJ05) and package it for use by the plotting scripts.

The OBSmatch.py script is provided because it contains useful subroutines.  

Manuscript figures are produced using the Python scripts which are named for the figure they produce, except Figure 6 which is produced using plot_tracertracer.py
